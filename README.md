Assessment for videoslots

I created the functions requested in PHP and in Java as I'm much more familiar with Java.
This was actually the first time I've used PHP.

The first two links contain the functions written in PHP, while the second two contain the same functions written in Java.

PHP Task 1_1 - https://onlinegdb.com/cTa-MwCmF

PHP Task 1_2 - https://onlinegdb.com/y2GHn3ry3

Java Task 1_1 - https://onlinegdb.com/fB6mU4hxV

Java Task 1_2 - https://onlinegdb.com/TGBELBT31

The 'Feature' files contain the test cases needed to test the functionality of both these functions. 

Addtionally I've included the two defect examples as screenshot from Jira + a screenshot of the example bug.
